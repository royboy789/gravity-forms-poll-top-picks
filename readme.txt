**Gravity Forms with Poll Add-On Required**
Need to grab the top 5, 10, etc. results from your poll? That is what this plugin does!

== Description ==

Gravity Forms is an awesome Wordpress plugin. Using the polls extension allows for more interaction with users. I wanted to a way to grab (in order) the top (5,10,etc.) results from the poll without looking at all the poll results. Great for polls with 10's or 100's of choices.

Looking to add default GF results percentages and counts shortly

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What attributes can I use for the `[gftop]` short code? =
`total` - how many do you want to show?
`formid` - which form do you want to use (mus be a poll)?
`poll_input` - which poll input do you want to get the top X of? First poll input defaults as 1
